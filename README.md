Answer to question: Careful planning of the structure of the HTML can assist with
identifying selectors in both CSS and Javascript. How do you think the structure of ttt3
helps or does not help with that goal?

Positives:
- Semantic HTML: Clear use of h2 and div with descriptive classes improves element selection based on their role.
- Meaningful class names: Classes like .table and .square enhance readability and targeting in CSS and Javascript. 

Area for improvement:
- Single game board: Adding features like multiple boards or advanced levels might require complex selectors.
